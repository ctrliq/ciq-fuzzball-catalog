  The BLAST example workflow provides a Fuzzball template to retrieve query sequences and either create
  a custom database or fetch a named blast database from NCBI. Public databases are cached in a
  persistent volume. Custom databases can be saved for later use as well. Note that some blast databases
  are large and may be costly to store.
