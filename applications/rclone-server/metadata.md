This application will start an [Rclone](https://rclone.org/) WebDAV or SFTP server that serves data from the mounted Fuzzball volumes and allows you to access, browse, upload, and download files from our Fuzzball persistent storage volumes using any compatible client.

The server runs on the specified port (default 8080).

To access the server, you'll need to use port-forwarding:
```
fuzzball workflow port-forward <workflow-id> <protocol> <port>:<port>
```

The full command will be included in the log for convenient copy-and-paste.

Then you can connect to the port on localhost with your client of choice.

## Client Tools for File Transfers

In addition to using rclone itself as a client tool, there are many graphical and
command-line clients you can use for transferring files to/from the rclone-based
SFTP/WebDAV server in Fuzzball.

### WebDAV Clients

- **Files** (Windows) - Native WebDAV support via "Map network drive"
- **Nautilus/Dolphin** (Linux) - File managers with built-in WebDAV support

Notes:

- The server job will run until it hits the timeout or you terminate it
  manually.
