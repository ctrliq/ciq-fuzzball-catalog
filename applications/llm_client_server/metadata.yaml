  This workflow starts an OpenAI compatible REST API server implemented with
  vLLM (https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable) using a model downloaded from
  HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/) in one job, and then runs a series of
  queries against the server from a second job in the same workflow. See
  https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/models/supported_models.html#supported-models
  for supported models. Once queries are done, the server is shut down.
